# 'Mixed Messages' Project
## A codecdemy project that is a message generator program. Every time a user runs the program, they get a new, randomized output.

### What is 'Mixed Messages'?
This program version of Mixed Messages is random positive affirmation thrown in with a bit of fun random future telling, and a chance of subtle humour.

This is possibly a more simple interpretation of the specification, as after completing I can see there was expectations of using at least a loop to output a few lines. However, I'm happy with this as the initial version as it appears to meet the specification and I wish to continue learning rather than spending too much time on a beginner project.

### Features
The program contains 3 arrays:
1. adjectives
2. nounPlace
3. nounPerson
The sentence uses 3 x adjectives, 2 x nounPlace and 1 x nounPerson items from these 3 arrays. All of which are randomly selected and will only be used once in the sentence; no duplicates.

### How to use/ run this program:
1. Download this program folder.
2. Ensure you have 'node' installed and a 'bash' command prompt.
3. Open bash command prompt and navigate to where you have this program folder saved using 'ls' and 'cd'.
4. When you have the tree as inside this program folder, type 'node main.js' in the bash command prompt.
5. The program will run once and provide you with 1 line of positive affirmation and fun future telling.
6. To run again, press the UP arrow on your keyboard to show the previous command 'node main.js', then press enter again.
7. Repeat step 6 for more random outputs.
